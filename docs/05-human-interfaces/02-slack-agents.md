## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does Smart Engage reduce costs by 80%+?
Smart Engage pre-screens every message in your configured channels using lightweight analysis before invoking your LLM. It only triggers your agent when the message is relevant to its purpose, eliminating thousands of unnecessary API calls to expensive language models.

### How does user authentication work?
Our built-in OAuth system allows each Slack user to authenticate their own accounts (GitHub, Jira, etc.) directly through Slack. Tokens are stored securely and scoped to individual users, ensuring agents can perform actions on behalf of specific users while maintaining security boundaries.

### Can agents respond to threads and maintain context?
Yes! Agents automatically understand thread context and maintain conversation history. They can respond appropriately whether in a channel, thread, or direct message, preserving the full context of the discussion.

### What file types can agents process?
Agents support multi-modal inputs including:
- Voice messages (automatically transcribed)
- Images (PNG, JPEG, GIF)
- PDFs and documents
- Code files
- CSV and structured data

### How fast can I deploy an agent?
From zero to live agent in under 5 minutes. If you're using a template, it's even faster - just click deploy, authorize Slack, and you're done. No infrastructure setup, no DevOps, no waiting.

### How do I control when my agent responds?
Multiple control mechanisms:
- **Smart Engage sensitivity:** Adjust how selective the pre-screening is
- **Auto-engage rules:** Define specific triggers and conditions
- **Channel permissions:** Control which channels the agent can access
- **@ mention only mode:** Require explicit mentions for responses

### Is this suitable for enterprise deployments?
Absolutely. We're SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and offer self-hosted options for enterprises requiring complete control. Our platform handles agents for Fortune 500 companies processing millions of messages.

### Can I bring my existing AI code?
Yes! Any Python-based AI code can be deployed as a Slack agent. Whether you've built with LangChain, CrewAI, or custom code, you can deploy it to Slack without modifications. We handle all the Slack integration complexity.
